#+TITLE: Hello!
I'm Santiago Nicol√°s Ruberto, and this is where I publish stuff that seems useful for me and other people.
* About me
I'm a Software Developer with a degree in Telematics Engineering. I've always been passionate about creating tools and applications to make life easier for myself and others. This focus has led me on a path through many facets of programming, from embedded to web development.

I started out making mods and small applications as a kid and teenager, and then making bigger projects in college while I was studying. So far, this has led me to several different projects I've done over these last few years:

- Working for a local startup on the firmware of a proprietary electric vehicle charging platform, basically leading and formalizing the development process.
- Helping out two of my classmates in development of a /WordPress/-/WooCommerce/ based storefront, working on and debugging the entire stack of the site.
- My final degree project[fn:1], which involved creating a distributed, scalable system for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping][scraping]] a job portal and retrieving data from hundreds of job offers in a structured way. This data would then be used in an academic study on non-economic benefits of those job offers.
